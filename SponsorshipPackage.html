“Dragon Boat Racing is the fastest growing water sport in the world and, because of its 

extreme popularity, is rated the second most popular sport in the world.” – Paddler Magazine 

What is Dragon Boat? 

Dragon Boat is a traditional Chinese Sport that originated over 2500 years. A dragon boat is a 

canoe-shaped vessel that is comprised of twenty paddlers, one steersman, and one drummer. 

During races, the boat is decorated with a dragonhead and tail. 

Who are we?

WLU Dragon Boat Club was founded in 2011 and is continuing to its fifth year as an official WLU 

Recreation Club Sport. Our team is comprised of over fifty active members, enabling the 

formation of two individual racing crews – competitive crews and recreational crews.

Since its founding, WLUDB has become a formidable force in the Waterloo/Kitchener dragon 

boat community. We participate in several races through Ontario region, such as Toronto Island 

Dragon Boat Race Festival, Woodstock Rotary Dragon Boat Festival, which are two of the 

largest dragon boat competitions in Ontario. We also participate in races in the United State, 

including Chicago International Dragon Boat Festival and Walgreen Orlando International 

Dragon Boat Festival, which are the two of the largest international dragon boat competitions 

in USA. 

Accomplishment in the last two years:

- St. Catharines Dragon Boat Festival (2014)

   University Mixed 1k A Consolation Final – Gold Medal & Trophy 

- Toronto Island Dragon Boat Race Festival (2014)

   Premier Mixed Final G 500m – Silver Medal

- Woodstock Rotary Dragon Boat Festival (2015)

   Bronze Division Championship Race 500m – Gold Medal 

The WLU’s success on the water is due to no small part of the spirit and dedication of each of its 

members. Rigorous 12-month practices are conducted on and off the water to help our 

members develop and perfect their paddling techniques, work ethic, and most importantly, 

their dedication to the sport.
